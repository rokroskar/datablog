</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Anyone who has spent time developing Spark applications (or any other distributed
application for that matter) has probably wished for some x-ray goggles into the 
black-box machinery of the framework. While Spark provides a nice UI for checking 
on the status of running tasks and even gives statistics on things like runtime, 
memory usage, disk I/O etc., there are other aspects of the runtime that can remain
an annoying mystery: how is the JVM memory being utilized? How much memory is the 
driver using? What about garbage collection? As it turns out, all these are reported
by Spark's metrics system: they're out there, you just need to grab them. </p>
